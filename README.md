# Coursera LLM Notebooks â€“ Cohere & LangChain Versions

This repository contains modified versions of Coursera notebook assignments and examples. I've adapted them to use:

- âœ… **[Cohere API](https://cohere.com/)** (free tier) instead of OpenAI or other paid models
- âœ… **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)** to integrate with open-source LLMs and tools

## ðŸ“š Purpose

While learning from Coursera courses on large language models and AI, I wanted to:
- Use **free and open LLMs**
- Explore **alternatives to OpenAI**, especially **Cohere**
- Gain hands-on experience with **LangChain** workflows

## ðŸ§ª Contents

Each notebook includes:
- The original Coursera code (where applicable)
- My modifications to:
  - Replace OpenAI calls with `Cohere` via `LiteLLM`
  - Use LangChain wrappers and components
