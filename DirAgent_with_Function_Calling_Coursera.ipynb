        "# Using LLM Function Calling for AI-Agent Interaction\n",
        "One of the most challenging aspects of integrating AI agents with tool execution is ensuring that the model consistently produces structured output that can be parsed correctly. Traditionally, developers would attempt to engineer prompts to make the model output well-formed JSON, but this approach is unreliableâ€”models can introduce variations, omit required fields, or output unstructured text that breaks parsing logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve this, most LLMs offer function calling APIs that guarantee structured execution. Instead of treating function execution as a free-form text generation task, function calling APIs allow us to explicitly define the tools available to the model using JSON Schema. The model then decides when and how to call these functions, ensuring structured and predictable responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "When using function calling, the model returns either:\n",
        "\n",
        "1 - **A function call** that includes the tool name and arguments as structured JSON.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2- **A standard text response** if the model decides a function is unnecessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach removes the need for manual prompt engineering to enforce structured output and allows the agent to focus on decision-making rather than syntax compliance."
